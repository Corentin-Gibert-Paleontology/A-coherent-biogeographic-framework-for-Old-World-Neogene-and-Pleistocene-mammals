## A coherent biogeographic framework for Old-World Neogene and Pleistocene mammals
### Supplementary material associated with Palaeontology manuscript of Gibert et al. 


Here is a repository to share Appendix, example scripts and public data used in the temporal and spatial analysis 

List of element:

- An R example script to produce the temporal and spatial analysis conducted in the main manuscript
- The end of this R script is dedicated to the use of "__.RData" files as well as the corresponding locality names with Latitude_Longitude labels used in Supplementary Materials.

- NOWBDD.txt is a text file with all NOW database occurrences from Old World mammals during Neogene, Pliocene and Pleistocene.
- Personal_function.R is a wrapper of R functions needed to complete the analysis (e.g. transformation of a faunal list to an occurrence matrix)
- ListeGRAIN01.RData is the dataset after thinning (it's a long process, with it you can use the rest of R script and skip the thinning step)
- A list of "__.RData" files used to store the locality and species names illustrated in the main manuscript. These files include the correspondance between Latitude_Longitude labels in supplementary materials and the actual locality names from NOW database.
